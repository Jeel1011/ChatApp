Registered users can log in and participate in real-time chat sessions.
Messages are stored in the database and displayed in a chat interface.
Chat messages are updated in real-time without page refresh using AJAX.

3. User Profiles:
Users have profile pages displaying their username and some basic information.
Profile pictures can be added and updated.

4. Database Integration:
MySQL is used to store user data, chat messages, and other application information.
PHPMyAdmin is included for database management and administration.
